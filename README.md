#PURPOSE:
    Create/Train an agent to play chinese checkers better than any average joe, while learning about all things programming and ML.

#WHAT:
    XIJINPING, a "Smart" agent behaviour that will beat most people playing chinese-checkers against it.

#HOW:
    Using object oriented python, we will create a way to represent the game, game results, and the agents.
    TensorFlow is the primary candidate for a tool to build an agent suitable to our purpose. A simple greedy agent will be used as a   baseline, to compare performance and sometimes train on.
	For a test drive, run the Greedy_Agent.py file

#WHY:
  Why do anything, it seemed like a good idea at the time of its inception.

#WHEN:
  Soon^TM 







#STATUS:

  *29.10.2018*
  No new commits just yet, some pondering required to set up what will amount to reinforcement learning. Q learning rule, tensorflow libs and visualising just how the agent will be trained.

  I have been able to work on this regularly in the last couple of days. This tides well for the future, as much progress has been made on the game implementation front, however, not much progress has been made on the ML front.

  *11.01.2019*
  This has been a bad christmas for personal programming projects, but better times are coming. Not much added this time, refamiliarizing with old code, and dipping toes into pyTorch.
